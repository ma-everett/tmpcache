At present,\r\nthe project also lacks documentation. \r\n\r\nBuild and Install\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nYou will need Crossroads I/O library installed and the scons build system. \r\n\r\n> scons\r\n\r\nAt the present time, I would not choice to install or use tmpcache\r\n(especially) for production. \r\n\r\nRunning\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n> tmpcache -m 64MB -s 1MB -w [waddress] -r [raddress] -c [dir]\r\n\r\nWhere _waddress_ (for writing) and _raddress_ (for reading) is \r\nan Crossroads adddress in one of the following forms.\r\n\r\n1. IPC:///tmp/write.tmpcache.ipc\r\n2. TCP://127.0.0.1:8888 \r\n\r\nMaximum memory is set with the *m* argument, the default is 64MB. \r\n\r\nThe maximum size of the data to cache, as set with the *s* argument, the\r\ndefault is 1MB. \r\n\r\n_dir_ is the directory (absolute path) where the cache will reside. To \r\nimprove the performance, use a *tmpfs* for the cache directory. \r\n\r\nCreating a Snapshot\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nBecause we use the filesystem, you can use the standard commands for copying\r\nfiles, however *tmpcache* provides to alternative methods of creating a\r\nsnaphot/copy of the cache. The first is to directly write the contents of\r\nthe cache to another cache.\r\n\r\n> tmpcache -s 1 -c [dir] -w [destination]\r\n\r\nWhere _destination_ is another cache. The second method is to create a \r\n[cdb](http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html#intro) database.\r\n\r\n> tmpcache -s [filename].cdb -c [dir]\r\n\r\nWhere _filename_ is an absolute path. This will create a database file which\r\nwe can then create a readonly cache. \r\n\r\n> tmpcache -c [filename].cdb -r [raddress]\r\n \r\n","name":"tmpcache","tagline":"Temporary cache written in C with Crossroads I/O library providing the network interface.
